      <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="diversknow.com">Divers know.</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>My name is Justin Jueden Pytel, I currently live in Seattle, WA. My biggest hobbies are scuba diving and outdoor hiking. Both hobbies allow me to spend time with my wife. She is my biggest supporter for going back to school. My proudest
        accomplishment is when I competed in the Army's best warrior competition. The competition is meant to test your knowledge in the army and medical field. The competition is very physically and emotional demanding. I did not win the competition in
        the end, but I was proud of myself for competing.</p>
      <p>I am a surgical technologist for Harborview in Seattle. I have been working in the operating room for 14 years now. This last couple of months have made it very interesting working in a hospital, but I was always told from day one to be
        flexible.I am working towards my Bachelors in Science in Business Development. When I finish my degree, I will Transition from the operating room to become a business analyst for a healthcare system. My goal is to finish my master‚Äôs degree at CTU and move
        up into senior leadership at my hospital.</p>
      <p>I recently partnered with my wife‚Äôs friend to develop a indie game company. I have enjoyed playing video games my whole life and have always wanted to learn how to make one. She is developing the art and story guideline and I am working on the
        backend coding to make the game functional. If anyone has worked in the field and can give me any pointers. Please let me know.
